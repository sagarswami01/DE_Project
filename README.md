# Azure Cloud Data Engineering: API-Driven ETL/ELT Pipelines

## 1. Project Overview

This project uses two datasets [Business Data](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis/about_data) and [Incident Reports](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data) from San Francisco government's public datasets website to provide following data-driven insights:
1. Hotspot Analysis: Crime rate in the vicinity of business locations
2. Correlation Analysis: Types of business more prone to specific types of crimes
3. Geospatial Analysis: Heatmaps and buffer analysis
4. Crisis Management: Plan emergency situations with nearby emergency services data

**Note:** This project only prepares and processes data to serve downstream applications, Data Science teams, and Business Owners for further analysis.
