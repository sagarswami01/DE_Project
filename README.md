# Azure Cloud Data Engineering: API-Driven ELT Pipelines

## Project Overview

This project uses two datasets [Business Data](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis/about_data) and [Incident Reports](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data) from San Francisco government's public datasets website to provide following data-driven insights:
1. Hotspot Analysis: Crime rate in the vicinity of business locations
2. Correlation Analysis: Types of business more prone to specific types of crimes
3. Geospatial Analysis: Heatmaps and buffer analysis
4. Crisis Management: Plan emergency situations with nearby emergency services data

**Note:** This project only prepares and processes data to serve downstream applications, Data Science teams, and Business Owners for further analysis.

## Key Technologies

Major tools/technologies used in this project:
1. Python (For API calls, transformations)
2. Azure Data Factory/Databricks (For orchestration)
3. Azure Blob Storage/Data Lake (For data storage)
4. Azure SQL (For metadata and logs)
5. Databricks (For loading and processing data)
6. Pandas, Pyspark (For transformations)
7. REST APIs (To fetch data)

## Datasets

Datasets used: [Business Data](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis/about_data) and [Incident Reports](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783/about_data)

Business Data: This dataset includes the locations of businesses that pay taxes to the City and County of San Francisco. Each registered business may have multiple locations and each location is a single row.

Incident Reports: This dataset includes incident reports that have been filed as of January 1, 2018. These reports are filed by officers or self-reported by members of the public using SFPDâ€™s online reporting system.

If you would like more information, you can visit the website.

Data Source Refresh Schedule:
Business Data - 04:11 AM PST

Incidents Data - 10:00 AM PST

**Note:** As refresh schedules are in PST, in this project the data fetch job is scheduled at 11:00 PM IST to fetch both datasets together considering reasonable buffer time.

Data Fetch Mechanism:
API authentication is not required as data is fetched using SODA API 2.0 endpoints (No restrictions on throttling limits)
However, if you need to implement authentication refer [developer's website](https://data.sfgov.org/profile/edit/developer_settings) to generate your API tokens and secrets.

## Challenges and Solutions

The major challenge here is to build a data model with a relation between these two datasets. As there is no direct key which relates both datasets it is difficult to join them directly.

**Hint:** Leverage location coordinates from both datasets to derive a common field between them to create a relationship required for generating required insights.

## How to run the project

To run the project files you should have an Azure/Databricks subscription.

Steps:
1. To fetch data use the PL_Source_Data_Load.json databricks job which triggers two tasks parallelly to fetch data and store JSON files in respective folders in blob storage further it reads the JSON files and stores them as a delta table in the bronze layer. This requires two notebooks/scripts NB_Source_Data_Load_Business_Data.py and NB_Source_Data_Load_Police_Dept.py inside the Notebooks folder.
2. Use the PL_Data_Process.json pipeline to further consume the bronze data and store processed data ready to implement business rules. This pipeline requires the NB_Silver_Transformations.py script inside the Notebooks folder.
3. Refer to job_cluster.json for cluster configurations and packages used for the project which is required to run above pipelines.

## Future Improvements

Currently, the workflow is orchestrated using databricks which can be extended to Azure Data Factory for complex frameworks. In addition to it, Azure SQL can be leveraged to store Pipeline Logs, Metadata, etc, and Logic Apps to send job alerts.
